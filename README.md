## **Algorithms Labs**
This repository contains a series of programming assignments from my Introduction to Algorithms course at Tulane University done in Python. These labs demonstrate my learned understanding of algorithmic concepts and my implementations of these concepts.

This repository includes five labs: a state machine lab, a search algorithm performance analysis lab, a pocket cube lab, a modular arithmetic lab, and a greedy optimization lab. Each lab introduces a unique computational problem and employs different techniques to solve the problem.

### **Lab Descriptions**
#### **State Machine Lab**
The objective of the state machine lab is to design and implement a finite state machine to model computational problems. This lab involves examples of string matching and input validation using a finite state machine.

#### **Search Algorithm Performance Analysis Lab**
The objective of the search algorithm performance analysis lab is to analyze and compare the performances of different search algorithms. This lab includes an implementation of breadth-first-search, depth-first-search, and Dijkstra’s algorithm. This lab uses test cases to compare time and space complexity.

#### **Pocket Cube Lab**
The objective of the pocket cube lab is to develop an algorithm to solve a 2x2 Rubik’s Cube. This lab includes the implementation of heuristic search algorithms to determine the optimal solution for the pocket cube.

#### **Modular Arithmetic Lab**
The objective of the modular arithmetic lab is to implement different modular arithmetic operations and test their performances.

#### **Greedy Optimization Lab**
The objective of the greedy optimization lab is to solve an employment matching problem using a greedy algorithm and transversal matroids. This solution included matching workers to jobs in a bipartite graph to maximize the value. This lab also included the use of breadth-first-search and greedy selection to optimize the efficiency of the computation.
